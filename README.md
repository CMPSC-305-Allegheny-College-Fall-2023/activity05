## Assigned: 5 October 2023

## Due: END OF CLASS

![bases](./graphics/office.png)

Workers in offices often create databases to contain the contact details of clients, customers and others. Often the data may arrive in files and the database architect will have to find a logical way to combine the names with their companies. This activity invites you take that work a bit further!

## Project Goals

* To gain experience using constraints to build database tables.
* To use SQL code to use the implied relationships in data to connect the tables.
* To gain experience with writing queries to determine that both tables of the database are connected.
* To gain experience adding primary key constraints.

## Instructions

Please address the TODO's in the markdown text file, `src/code.md`. You are to submit this work to your GitHub repository at least three (3) times. Be sure to use integrity constraints other than `VARCHAR` and to add a `PRIMARY KEY` for one of the attributes.

## Project Assessment

This is a check mark grade. Your work will be considered complete when you see the green check-mark at the top of page of your GitHub repository.

## GatorGrade

You can check the baseline writing and commit requirements for this lab assignment by running department's assignment checking `gatorgrade` tool. To use `gatorgrade`, you first need to make sure you have Python3 installed (type `python --version` to check). If you do not have Python installed, please see:

- [Setting Up Python on Windows](https://realpython.com/lessons/python-windows-setup/)
- [Python 3 Installation and Setup Guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
- [How to Install Python 3 and Set Up a Local Programming Environment on Windows 10](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-python-3-and-set-up-a-local-programming-environment-on-windows-10)

Then, if you have not done so already, you need to install `gatorgrade`:

- First, [install `pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/)
- Then, install `gatorgrade` with `pipx install gatorgrade`

Finally, you can run `gatorgrade`:

`gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml`
